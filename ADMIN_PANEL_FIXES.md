# Admin Panel Fixes and Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes and improvements made to the Admin Panel to address runtime errors, warnings, and enhance functionality.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Runtime Errors Fixed

#### TypeError: item.specs.text.map is not a function
- **Problem**: The code was trying to call `.map()` on `item.specs.text` without checking if it was an array
- **Solution**: Added proper array validation:
  ```tsx
  {item.specs.text && Array.isArray(item.specs.text) && item.specs.text.length > 0 && (
    <div>Text: {item.specs.text.map(t => t.text).join(', ')}</div>
  )}
  ```

#### Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection
- **Problem**: Chrome extension connection errors in development
- **Solution**: Added error boundary and try-catch blocks to handle connection issues gracefully

#### Fetching asset failed with status code [404]
- **Problem**: Wix-specific asset loading errors
- **Solution**: Added fallback mechanisms and error handling for external asset failures

### 2. Console Warnings Addressed

#### Message from unauthorized origin
- **Problem**: Wix domain not in allowed origins list
- **Solution**: Added `https://www.evogearstudio.com` to allowed origins and improved origin validation

#### react-i18next warning
- **Problem**: Old wait option usage
- **Solution**: Acknowledged as a third-party library warning that doesn't affect functionality

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

#### Global Error Boundary
- Added comprehensive error boundary with:
  - Global error event listeners
